### Documentantion for F Weather

This App will gather two sets of data, based on the entered ZIP code or the location provided by the web browser: The current data, gathered from OpenWeather, and Historical Climate Data, from Wunderground.

Historical data contains the averages (High and Low) for that month in the last 30 years.

The main purpose is to show the current temperature in context. A given temperature may seem hot but for a determined region, may be normal. For example, someone in Miami may find 80 degrees reasonable for a summer afternoon.

Once determined the current temperature in historical context, a humurous message is chosen randomly from a group of 10 possible cases.

An icon based on current weather condition is also picked, and displayes with the current temperasture in.

The background color will vary according to the current temperature, also in context, from blue to the minimal low historical tem for that month and that place, to the highest historical high.

A Gauge will animate to show the current temperature in a range that varies from the minimal historical low to the highest historical high, and two markers indicate the historical low average and the historical high average.
