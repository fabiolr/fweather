This App will gather two sets of data, based on the entered ZIP code or the location provided by the web browser.

The current data, gathered from OpenWeather, and Historical Climate Data, from Wunderground.

Historical data contain the averages (High and Low) for that month in the last 30 years.

The main purpose is to show the current temperature in a contex base. A given temperature may seem hot but for a determined region, may be normal. For example, someone from Miami may find 80 degrees reasonable for a summer afternoon.

Once determined the current temperature in historical context, a humurous message is chosen randomly from a group of 10 possible situations, and displayed.
